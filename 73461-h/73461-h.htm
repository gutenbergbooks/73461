<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">OF DRAGONS<br>
<small>PREFACE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I have been asked to explain the
purpose of this study. I find a ridiculous
difficulty in doing so, for it had
none. My interest in dragons was
aroused by some incidental paragraphs
in Leslie Stephen’s <i>The Playground of
Europe</i>. I determined to find out all
that there was to be known about
dragons: with the unfailing assistance
of that great institution, the London
Library, I made a fairly careful search;
and, when I had exhausted my authorities
(to whom I am greatly indebted),
I set down with some pleasure the facts
that had come under my notice. That
is all.</p>

<p>In case it should be objected that no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
sane man could have done anything so
elaborately purposeless, I will attempt
a more plausible explanation—though
the truth is exactly what I have said.</p>

<p>The first four sections give a fair
account of the dragon as known to
history: in ancient Greece, in early
Christendom, and in modern Europe.
The last two endeavour to explain how
the dragon-story may have originated
from the myths and customs of prehistoric
Egypt, and how humanly
foolish the whole thing is; and they
close with the pious hope that the
species may in time become extinct.</p>

<p>It will be objected that the dragon
is already dead, as has been shown in
the course of the study. It is true that
the living, breathing, devouring dragon
has passed away with Perseus and the
gods of old; we have to-day only an
occasional saga, such as the “Jabberwock,”
a pale reflection of the full-blooded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
ancient tales, lacking many
essential details and almost apologized
for by its author; a herald’s act of
piety, or the unreal enthusiasm of an
æsthete vainly seeking de-sophistication.
It is all a faint afterglow of the
age of faith. And yet, in England at
any rate, the dragon is not dead.</p>

<p>What are the chief characteristics of
modern Englishmen—not the ornaments
of society, nor artists, nor any
other lovely ones, but these poor plain
people who earn their daily bread,
with or without the sweat of their
brows, because they must; who make
up nine-tenths of our population; who
control our political destinies; and
whom the Carlton Club delights to
honour?</p>

<p>They are respectability, bigotry, and
cant. There can be no doubt about
this. The consequence is that the men
have no character and the women no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
charm, and we rule over a quarter of
the world with complete satisfaction to
ourselves. These three together make
up our modern dragon. Respectability
is the deadliest, for it is a plausible substitute
for better things; but it is a
dead end, like innocence.</p>

<p>Most men who have realized the
existence of this monster apparently
try to meet it by joining the Labour
Party. There is nothing immoral about
that, but I pin my faith to the less
dogmatic method of general education.
It is curious, by the way, to note that
the devil is historically associated with
knowledge and not with ignorance. It
would take too long to explain how this
bogey came to be hoisted, but it is still
very commonly made use of to frighten
children, and my true purpose is to
plead that it <i>is</i> only a bogey, and that
ignorance is the devil’s most effective
weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>The devil’s advocate might argue
much as follows:</p>

<p class="hang">1. “You don’t really like the ‘vulgar’—they
are not as interesting
as your own friends.</p>

<p class="hang">2. “It will come to nothing. What
<i>is</i> the ultimate value of ‘free
discussion’ and ‘reasoning without
prejudice’ among people
who don’t read and can’t think?</p>

<p class="hang">3. “In so far as you do succeed, you
will merely make them miserable:
as thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">‘Happiness is the end of life.</p>

<p class="noi">‘It consists of (<i>a</i>) the admiring
contemplation of the truly
admirable, and the delighted
companionship of the truly
delightful. This is the best.
(<i>b</i>) The second best is to
enjoy in imagination what
you know to be imaginary.
(<i>c</i>) The third best is to enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
mistakenly what is in fact
non-existent or ugly.</p>

<p class="noi">‘There is no other good.’</p>
</div>

<p>“All this is A B C, and no longer
worth arguing about. Then imagine
a man well content with a mistaken
religion, a dreary home, and an unlovely
wife (and this describes nearly all mankind).
What happens when you educate
him? It is difficult for him to
change his wife, very difficult to change
his religion, and impossibly difficult to
change his home—and the man is uprooted
and miserable for life.”</p>

<p>The answer is: This is all substantially
true (which is the definition of
caricature). Comfortable folk too
commonly ignore the prosaic foundations
of imperishable things. Many of
the more delightful virtues are impossible
vices to men struggling for the
bare necessities of life (as you may see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
any day if you try to practise ordinary
courtesy in mounting a ’bus), and it is
complacent cant to propose such virtues
to them. And men so struggling are not
altogether delightful. The point about
them is, by what right or merit of yours
do you live so much more easily, with
so many more opportunities of the
good life; and do you use your opportunities?
And can you be of any use
to others less fortunate than yourself?
For the rest:</p>

<p>(1) The argument defends too much.
It defends every <i>status quo</i> against all
change. But change, though not necessarily
progress, is evidently necessary
to progress; and, even if progress be
despaired of, change is in itself nearly
always healthy. It prevents men from
going to sleep.</p>

<p>(2) When all the world is delightful,
all men will be able to enjoy delightful
companionship. Meanwhile, the pioneers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
must suffer, and hope for better things
for their children.</p>

<p>If it be argued that education does
not make men delightful, in fact very
much the contrary, I answer that that
depends upon the education, and that,
if genuine education doesn’t, nothing
will; which is absurd.</p>

<p>(3) When all the world loves lovely
things, then lovely things will be easily
come by, and ugly things will not be
tolerated. This is not a generous
illusion but a simple economic truth.
Suppose I manufacture purple handkerchiefs
adorned with green dragons:
I do it because there is a demand, and
if you want one perfectly plain (and
if nobody else does) you will have to
pay twice as much for it because it
is a “special”; but if all the world
wanted them plain, they would be a
stock line and you could have them
for half the money. Meanwhile, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
pioneers must pay double or go without.</p>

<p>(4) When all the world has passed
through the stage of intelligent scepticism
and examined its foundations, it
will worship the unknown god without
fear and without reproach—a very
right and proper thing to do. Meanwhile,
the pioneers must be damned
dissenters.</p>

<p>That is the gist of this study:
“Methinks I see in my mind a noble
and puissant nation....” Good (<i>b</i>) is
in itself better than (<i>c</i>); and it is a
half-way house to (<i>a</i>), which (<i>c</i>) is not.</p>

<p>All the textbooks tell us about the
nature and origin of belief. I have
but shown a few examples of what
incredible things men believed almost
down to our own day, and still believe.
One of the chief functions of History
is to show what wrongs good men have
tolerated, and what absurdities wise
men have believed, as a warning to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
their later sons to look warily about
them for the like. In that sense this
study may claim to be true history.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">OF DRAGONS<br>
<small>(An Introduction to the Study of Man)</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I must first ask your pardon for
troubling you with this digression, but
the facts and the theories are so many
and curious and the whole subject is of
such vital importance, that I dared not
trust to my memory alone. It must be
admitted that most of the facts recorded
are obviously untrue and that most of
the theories are unsupported by evidence
and highly improbable; though
the facts are guaranteed by the highest
authorities of the most ancient religions
and the theories upheld by the most
eminent modern scientists. Whence
it is evident that I, like Sir John
Mandeville, “have taken pains to
ascertain the exact truth”; and yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
I think that from this jumble of superstitions
and fables and conjectures and
absurdities there does emerge something
that may repay you for the
weariness of an hour, and throw some
light upon the hopes and fears with
which the unconquerable spirit of man
has progressed through the ages to the
crowning triumphs of this twentieth
century. Indeed, as Sir Thomas
Browne finely says in his Preface:
“A work of this nature is not to be
performed upon one legg: and should
smell of oyl, if duly and deservedly
handled.” And, on second thoughts,
I fully and unreservedly withdraw my
apology.</p>

<p>I shall begin with some attempt to
define our subject, and then take you
through the dragons of classical antiquity
and early Christendom down to
the twilight uncertainty of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the blank incredulity of our modern
age. I shall then go back to the earliest
legends of all—the Egyptian, and close
with an attempt to harmonize the
whole, and with a critical estimate of
the place of the dragon in human
thought and experience.</p>

<small>OF DRAGONS IN GENERAL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In Glastonbury, where St. Dunstan
took the devil by the nose and where
the Pilgrim’s Inn is dedicated to St.
George and the Dragon, the dragon
will always be an object of peculiar
interest, not to say veneration. (So
true is this that on the 16th October,
1906, the Somerset County Council, on
the advice of its Chairman, adopted as
its sole device “Gules, a dragon rampant,
or,” though the recognition of its
increasing importance has since led it to
add—15th October, 1912—the mace of
office, “at a cost not exceeding £20.”)</p>

<p class="noi">and St. John (<i>Revelation</i>, xx, 2)
speaks of “the Dragon, the old Serpent,
which is the Devil and Satan,” while the
Serpent that tempted Eve in Paradise
has been familiar to us all since our
earliest childhood; though commentators
differ as to whether it appeared
with a virgin’s head (as some say) and
how it was enabled to speak, and in
Eve’s own language; and why the event
excited no surprise in her. (Milton
tells us—<i>Paradise Lost</i>, ix, 550, and
what follows—that it did, and that
“not unamazed” she took up the
matter with the Serpent, which explained
that it had been elevated above
all the “other beasts that graze” by
tasting of the tree of knowledge. This
answer at once satisfied Eve and lured
her on to her fall. The whole account
is circumstantial but undocumented.)
Some say that Eve was inexperienced
with animals, not having been present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
when Adam named them; Eugubinus
suggests that the Serpent was a basilisk,
at that time harmless; and the
Emperor Julian said roundly that the
whole story was a fable. However that
may be, the dragon has been identified
with nearly all the gods and devils of
nearly all the religions of nearly all
mankind—primitive man does not distinguish
between the two, both being
primarily non-moral beings of enormous
and terrifying power—and Christian
evidence is undivided in associating
the dragon with the powers of darkness.
And what could be more natural than
that a dragon should take up its abode
in or near Glastonbury, this region of
hills and swamps? For it is universally
admitted that dragons are to be found
on the tops of mountains or in the
depths of marshes, and it is a generally
accepted test of evidence that what has
been believed by all men everywhere in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
every age is true—absurd, perhaps, but
not more absurd than the modern
opinion that what one man has once
believed is true.</p>

<p>We need not pause long over those
other meanings of “Dragon” which so
confused our forefathers and so delight
our contemporary compilers of dictionaries:
we do not propose to study that
Dragon (Draco) who gave stringent
laws to the ancient Athenians, nor the
variety of carrier-pigeon known to
natural history under that name, nor
the star called Dragon, nor quicksilver,
nor (directly) the sea-serpent, nor the
flying lizard; nor have we any concern
with the dragoons, who take their name
either from the dragon wrought upon
their guns or from the fact that they
were originally mounted infantry, and
so a kind of fabulous monster or
“popular mystery.” Our subject is the
common (or garden) dragon, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
major vertebrates, blood-red or chameleon-hued,
with huge snake-coils, web-feet,
bat-wings, and the head of a lion
or an eagle, capable of snuffing up the
wind (<i>Jeremiah</i>, xiv, 6) and holding
companionship with owls (<i>Job</i>, xxx,
29) though some say that the bird intended
is the ostrich. It dwelt of old in
mountain-caves, and lakes and marshes,
and other inaccessible places (the fiercer
sort favoured the mountains), and
survives to-day only in heraldry, for
instance, in the arms of the City of
London, and of His Royal Highness
the Prince of Wales. More peculiar
and detailed descriptions of the animal
will follow later, but it is well to note
here its special partiality for water and
for swallows (whence swallows flying
low are to this day popularly supposed
to herald rain), and its habit of guarding
treasures—gold, pearls, and precious
stones—and of emitting thunder and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
lightning. Eating its heart confers
peculiar qualities, notably fertility and
the gift of tongues, and the draconite
or precious stone which lies embedded
in its forehead has incredible properties
in the way of medicine and magic, but
only if you catch the animal alive and
remove the stone without otherwise
injuring it. (The recorded instances
of this feat are remarkably rare, most
authentic draconites having fortunately
fallen from the head of the beast while
in flight, very much as a meteorite
might fall to-day.)</p>

<p>Without further theorizing or inquiry,
we will pass on to the old Greek
legend of Perseus, pausing only for the
pleasant task of exploding one particularly
absurd opinion about the origin of
the dragon. Sceptics have suggested
that it is nothing but primitive man’s
hazy and terrified tradition of the antediluvian
monsters which walked the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
early earth and which adorn the first
pages of Mr. Wells’ <i>Outline of History</i>;
but science now tells us that something
like seven million years elapsed between
the passing of the last of these and the
first appearance of the first of our fairly
human forebears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br>
<small>OF DRAGONS IN CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There were numerous dragons in old
Greece, “gorgons and hydras and
chimæras dire,” and all the best heroes
had at least one apiece to their credit;
but they were a confusing and unfriendly
lot, and we will confine ourselves
to the central legend of Perseus.</p>

<p>“An oracle warned Acrisius, King of
Argos, that he would surely die by the
hand of his daughter Danæ’s son. To
prevent this, he locked the fair maiden
in a tower of brass, which he built for
the purpose. But Zeus, king of Heaven,
visited her in the disguise of a golden
shower of rain, and, much to Acrisius’
annoyance, she bore a son, Perseus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Acrisius then shut them up in a chest
and cast them into the sea; but, far
from being drowned or inconvenienced
by the motion, the babe slumbered as in
a rocking cradle, and in due course the
chest was drawn safely ashore on
Seriphos by Dictys, brother to Polydektes,
king of that island, who took
the pair under his protection. Time
passed, and Polydektes sought to marry
the unwilling Danæ, and, to get rid of
Perseus, now a strapping lad, sent him
off to kill Medusa and bring home her
head. Medusa was a kind of dragon
called a Gorgon, who, though mortal
herself, had two immortal sisters.
Their parentage, though obscure, was
extremely distinguished, whence their
troubles; for as half-castes they had no
lot or portion with gods or men, which
to three lively young women (as they
then were) was insufferably dull. Their
speaking countenances betrayed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
depth of their more than human suffering,
so much so that in course of time
they became so terrible to look upon
that any man who should see them
would be turned to stone at sight. In
this awkward predicament Perseus was
fortunate in possessing friends in high
places. The goddess Athene gave him
a mirror, to strike the creature after
the manner of a man shaving, without
directly looking on her—an awkward
and unconvincing manœuvre. The god
Hades gave him a helmet of invisibility,
apparently of a higher class than the
device adopted by Old Peter in the Bab
Ballad. (He, you will remember, duly
became invisible, but his clothes did
not; whence divers inconveniences.)
Or perhaps the hero travelled in
primitive simplicity (but that wouldn’t
account for his weapons). The god
Hermes gave him his own winged shoes,
and the god Hephæstus a mortal blade.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Armed with these contrivances, and
luckily finding the Gorgons asleep,
Perseus completed his task and started
for home with the head in a travelling-bag
with which he had prudently
provided himself (for the head was still
fatal to view). On his way he turned
Atlas to stone (and you can see the
Atlas mountains to this day), either out
of pity for his sufferings—he had to
hold up all heaven on his head, and
heaven was, as in early Christendom,
completely solid—or, as some say, in
revenge for some trivial rudeness. If so,
it is a regrettable blot on his otherwise
unsullied escutcheon; for even Medusa
had longed to die. Flying on, he next
beheld Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus
king of Ethiopia, bound to a rock and
waiting to be devoured by a dragon.
This dismal scene had been staged by
Zeus to appease the Old Man of the Sea,
because the king’s wife had boasted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
that she (or, some say, her daughter)
was more beautiful than the nymphs
of the sea. Perseus rapidly appreciated
the situation, pressed the terrified
damsel to marry him (about which in
her distress she made no difficulty,
though already betrothed to her uncle
Phineus, who was safely under cover at
home), killed the instrument of divine
vengeance when it lumbered up clumsily
from the sea, so that the waves ran red
with its blood—and duly married
Andromeda. The skulking uncle made
a regrettable scene at the ceremony,
and the bloody fight was terminated
only by Perseus producing the fatal
head of Medusa, which turned his
enemies to stone. Returning home
with his bride, he restored his grandfather,
who had been dethroned by a
wicked brother, and reached Seriphos
in time to save his mother from Polydektes,
whom he replaced by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
faithful Dictys. Shortly afterwards he
was throwing the hammer at some
sports organized by a neighbouring
monarch, when his aged grandfather
unluckily got in the way and received
a fatal blow on the head; and the old
oracle was fulfilled. Perseus inherited
his kingdom, and begot a numerous
progeny; but this idyllic scene was
overshadowed by the gloom of the
accident, and he found no peace until
he exchanged thrones with the king of
Tiryns, where he lived to a ripe old age,
and died, universally lamented, in the
bosom of his family.”</p>

<p>Such is the old Greek legend: two
dragons, a supernatural birth, supernatural
weapons, faithful and wicked
brothers, a rescued maiden, and the
inexorable doom of Fate. We shall
come back to this in our conclusion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br>
<small>OF DRAGONS IN EARLY CHRISTENDOM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There were numerous dragons in
early Christendom, “gorgons and
hydras and chimæras dire,” and all
the best saints had at least one apiece
to their credit; but they were a confusing
and unfriendly lot, and we will
confine ourselves to the central legend
of St. George.</p>

<p>“St. George is one of that numerous
class of Saints about whom nothing
authentic is known”: but, piecing
together the <i>Golden Legend</i> and the
Portuguese and Balkan variants, we
arrive at the following:</p>

<p>“The people of Troyan were sunk in
all manner of iniquity, which greatly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
shocked Our Lady, who happened to
visit the place. Returning to Heaven,
she protested to God, who sent bears to
frighten them into righteousness. This
proved of no avail, and, on the suggestion
of Elijah, God then sent them all
manner of plagues and poxes for seven
years, but without result; he then sent
a drought for a similar period, and, as
they still remained unconverted, he
created a lake in the neighbourhood and
in it a dragon which visited the city
three times a day and devoured three
hundred inhabitants at each visit; in
addition to these ‘hearty meals’ it
demanded a virgin nightly, and at last
the lot fell upon the king’s daughter;
after obtaining eight days’ grace for
lamentation, he was finally forced to
abandon her with his blessing; but the
blessed George (a child of supernatural
birth, induced by his mother’s eating
a peculiar fish), passing by on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
dappled courser with his mortal lance,
greeted her in the name of God and
inquired why she was there; after
hearing her story and satisfying himself
as to her faith and morals (‘Had
her heart always been pure?’ etc.) he
dismounted and planted his lance in
the earth. He then laid his head in her
lap, saying: ‘Pray examine my head
a little, for I feel strangely sleepy.’
Under the soothing influence of her
gentle fingers he fell asleep, and the
abrupt transitions of a traditional ballad
do not enable us to judge whether the
damsel was long occupied in removing
the consequences of his saintly disregard
for cleanliness; while he rested,
the lake rose in waves and the dragon
emerged. The bashful maid was
ashamed to waken her deliverer, but her
tears rolled down upon his face and he
leapt up like one possessed, and,
fortified with the sign of the Cross,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
heavily wounded the dragon. ‘Pass thy
girdle round its neck, nothing doubting
(said he) and lead it into the city, and
bid them be converted: if they refuse,
set free the insatiable dragon and he
will destroy the people of Troyan.’
The argument thus presented on his
behalf by the Princess proved irresistible
and they were converted to the number
of 20,000 excluding women and children.
The fate of the dragon is uncertain, but
one version tells, in some detail, how it
was then killed and how four pairs of
oxen were required to remove it. The
grateful monarch erected a Church to
Our Lady and St. George (whose
promotion appears to have been
remarkably rapid) and offered him
money and his daughter to wife. But
that holy and unambitious man replied,
‘Give the money to the poor, care for
the Church, honour the priests, and
diligently attend divine worship.’ As to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
the daughter, the difficulty is that
George, by virtue of vows he has
taken, cannot marry. At this critical
moment his brother sees by a magical
life-token that George is in danger, and,
hurrying off, arrives in time to accommodate
his tender conscience by taking
the lady himself and leaving George
the honours of canonization.” Virtue
always triumphs in fairy-tales.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such is the early Christian legend:
A dragon, a supernatural birth, a
helpful horse, a faithful brother, a
life-token, and a rescued maiden; and
“the Church may be congratulated on
having converted and canonized the
pagan hero Perseus.” But before
passing on to more modern evidence,
it will be well to give some account of
the popular variants which circulated
all over the world as fairy-tales, superstitions,
or romances, almost down to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
our own day. The point in this case is
not so much who told or believed or
guaranteed them, but the simple fact of
their having been told.</p>

<p>They consist almost invariably of
four incidents: the supernatural birth,
the life-tokens, the helpful animals or
the magic weapons, and the rescued
maiden.</p>

<p>(The most recent I believe to be the
poem on the “Jabberwock,” which
occurs in <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>.
The hero, though evidently somebody’s
child (“Come to my arms, my beamish
boy”), has no undoubted sire. The
tum-tum tree (“So rested he by the
tum-tum tree”) is probably a life-token.
His vorpal sword (“His vorpal
blade went snicker-snack”) is without
doubt a magic weapon, and the “slithy
toves,” “mome raths,” and “borogroves”
may well be helpful animals.
The rescued maiden is not specifically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
mentioned, but it is difficult to explain
in any other way the behaviour of the
monster (“manxome,” “whiffling,”
“burbled”) or the motives of the
hero).</p>

<p><i>The Supernatural Birth.</i> “Heroes of
extraordinary achievement or extraordinary
qualities were necessarily of
extraordinary birth. The wonder or
the veneration they inspired seemed to
demand that their entrance upon life,
and their departure from it, should
correspond with the impression left by
their total career.” It is scarcely an
exaggeration to say that every old
Oriental tale begins with the words:
“There was a king who had no
children,” and the means adopted by
them for achieving their pious purpose
may be the eating of fish, fruit, barleycorns,
eggs, saltpetre, or a dragon’s
heart. There are dangers in all these
unusual methods, as in the case of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
man who was given a male and a female
fish of which his wife was to eat one
according to the sex desired. Wanting
a son, and to guard against accident,
the rash man ate the female fish himself,
“with the wholly unexpected result
that he himself gave birth to a
daughter.” In another case, the
dragon’s heart, while being cooked,
“began to emit a pitch-black smoke so
powerful in its effects that the condition
not merely of the queen (who tasted
the heart) but of the maiden who
cooked it, as well as of every article of
furniture in the room, became interesting.
The old four-post bedstead gave
birth to a cradle,” and so on and so
forth—a very economical method of
furnishing. In European tales, on the
other hand, “the medicine is more
frequently used to gratify spite against
an unfortunate maiden” by putting her
unwittingly in blessed circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
In every case at least one child is born
“of powers, it need hardly be said, as
remarkable as his parentage.” Other
substances which are “sovran against
barrenness” are water, wind, sun, and
a magic touch.</p>

<p><i>The Life-tokens.</i> Very commonly the
hero has one or two brothers born with
him in the same miraculous way, and
they set out on their fortunes together.
What enables them to keep in touch
when they part is a magic life-token,
also born with them in the same way—for
instance, a tree which grows from
part of the fish planted in the garden at
the time that their mother ate her part.
Each one of them will have such a tree
or branch which thrives or withers
according to his own fortunes, and by
this token each knows when the other
is in danger, and comes to his rescue
as in the case of St. George. Sometimes
it is a magic mirror, in which only the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
party concerned can see the fate of his
brother—“no doubt the eye of faith
was required to see anything in it.”
By this means the brothers invariably
rescue each other, or, if they come too
late or if a witch has turned the unlucky
one to stone, either the witch thoughtfully
provides the elixir of life or she is
killed and it is found among her
effects, or the faithful animals find it.
Safely reunited, they commonly agree
upon the division of their very considerable
spoils; but in some cases
they fall out and one kills the other,
in which case the “elixir of life” comes
into play again and they all live happily
ever after. It may well be that the
repentant brother will see two snakes
fighting: one kills the other, but in
remorse brings it to life again with a
magic herb: the sagacious fellow takes
the hint, and all is well again.</p>

<p><i>The Helpful Animals.</i> These are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
often begotten together with and in
the same miraculous way as the heroes
and the life-tokens. Arranged according
to what we may now call “the
Bovril principle,” they come in the
following order: horses, dogs, hawks,
lions, wolves, falcons, bears, foxes,
eagles, ants, dog-fishes, bulls, calves,
hares, boars, cats, winged horses, and
deer.</p>

<p><i>The Magic Weapons.</i> These are an
obviously later variant of the same idea
and, on the same principle, stand in the
following order: lance, shield, sword,
pistol, gun, magic wand, stick, bow and
arrow, knife, beer, stole, magic water,
powder-horn, air-gun, iron staff, 500-lb.
club, mace, and crucifix.</p>

<p><i>The Rescued Maiden.</i> In every case
the function of the hero and all his
apparatus is to rescue a distressed
maiden from a monster to whom she is
being sacrificed to appease the Gods.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Often the hero, having rescued the
lady, “ungallantly refuses to see her
home, saying that he wishes to see a
little more of the world.” But, before
departing, he takes some token—the
dragon’s tongue or eye or other part,
or the lady’s handkerchief or other
ornament. His desertion leaves her a
prey to the first impostor who comes
along, claims the victory for himself
and the lady in marriage. In the nick
of time the hero returns and shows up
the impostor “and poetical justice is
completed by his marriage with the
lady” (who has always fallen in love
with him at first sight), while her
sisters (for she has two sisters) are
commonly given to the two other
princes (for he has two brothers).</p>

<p>As I have said, all the best Saints
performed feats of this nature, including
the Holy Apostles Philip and Matthew,
St. Michael, St. Margaret, St. Hilarion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
St. Donatus, St. John, St. Sylvester,
Pope Leo IV, and a man named Smith
(at Deerhurst in Gloucestershire). It
is also told of a boy who was carried
off by a dragon that, after long years,
he was found in its cave “alive and
reading the Gospel, which was held up
before him by St. Friday, while St.
Sunday further contributed to his convenience
by holding the candle.”</p>

<p>Scarcely ten miles from Glastonbury
a terrible dragon lived once on Aller
Hill over beyond High Ham. His
fiery breath destroyed the people and
their flocks and herds, and he was particularly
partial to maidens. The
climax came when a young man called
one morning to fetch his bride away
to Church: her home</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p class="noi">and the foul monster had carried her
off to his cave. The bridegroom swore,
in his despair, that “earth should no
longer hold a thing so vile,” and,
marching off with his friends, killed the
dragon and rescued his bride; but the
story ends on a classical note of tragedy,
for she died of horror in his house that
very day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br>
<small>OF DRAGONS IN MODERN EUROPE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It will be well to begin this section
with short accounts of the two most
satisfactory Renaissance dragons: the
Dragon of Rhodes and the Dragon of
Bologna.</p>

<p>“The history of the ancient Order of
the Knights of St. John (not yet removed
to Malta) records that about the
year 1330 Dieudonné de Gozon, afterwards
third Grand Master of the Order,
joined the Knights in Rhodes, and was
filled with pious zeal to kill a terrible
dragon which ravaged the Island; but
the then Grand Master considered such
extravagant gaieties too dangerous for
a knight vowed to the defence of
Christendom, and roundly forbade it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
On this de Gozon returned to the castle
of his ancestors near Tarascon in
France, and, with the help of an ingenious
dummy dragon (so little does
the art of war change), trained his
horses and dogs to face the monster,
and, returning, killed it and removed its
tongue as evidence. A lying Greek (so
little does the Greek nature change)
found the carcase and claimed the victory;
but de Gozon showed him up by
producing the tongue—and was put in
prison for disobedience. The Pfalzgraf
Ottheinrich made our first written record
of this feat when passing through
on a pilgrimage in 1521, and the corroborative
evidence is indisputable: the
feat is said to have been recorded on the
tombstone of the knight (we have the
tombstone, and it isn’t); there are
said to be pictures of it in a wall-painting
in a house in Rhodes (which cannot
be found); and the family are said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
have preserved the draconite taken by
the hero from the monster’s forehead
(the family has disappeared); the head
itself was seen by a seventeenth century
traveller still nailed to a gate in Rhodes,
though it disappeared during the last
century. For countless years the simple
islanders had displayed it for the glory
of God and without thought of gain,
and it would perhaps be uncharitable
to connect its disappearance with the
recent development of transatlantic
transport, or with the discoveries of
modern science, which have shown that
the skeleton of the dun-cow at Warwick
is simply that of a whale. And, finally,
they will show you to this day in
Rhodes the cave where the dragon
lived.”</p>

<p>The story of the Dragon of Bologna
is tame by comparison. It is recorded
in great detail in <i>The Natural History
of Serpents and Dragons</i> by Professor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
Ulysses Aldrovandus, published at
Bologna by Mark Antony Bernia in
the year 1640, at his own charges, with
a dedication to the Prince-Abbot
Franciscus Perettus, and with the
approval of the Holy Roman Emperor
Rudolph, the Rector to the Cardinal-Archbishop
of Bologna, and the legal
adviser to the Most Holy Office of the
Inquisition in that city.</p>

<p>The story is as follows (p. 402):
“In the early summer of the year 1572,
to wit on the 13th of May, the dragon
appeared in the outskirts of Bologna,
hissing horribly. It was caught the
day after Ascension Day by a cowherd
called Baptista of Camaldulus, about
5 P.M. and about seven miles out from
the City, on the high road. His cows
saw it and stopped dead, and Baptista,
who was behind with his cart, pricked
them on with his goad; but they went
down on their knees and wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
budge. Then he heard a great hissing
and beheld the astounding monster:
but though frightened out of his wits,
he up with his stick and knocked it on
the head so that it died. The brave
herd, fearing it might not be dead, cut
off one of its feet and brought it into
Bologna as evidence. After three days
the noble Horatius Fontana gave orders
for the carcase to be sent to the great
naturalist Aldrovandus, who declared
it to be unique in all Italy and all
Europe, and had it stuffed and put in
the museum (whence it has unluckily
disappeared). It was about this same
time that the flying dragon appeared
by night in the sky, and no sane man
will doubt that these portents were
sent in honour of Pope Gregory XIII,
who took office in that year and who
sported a dragon on his coat-of-arms.”</p>

<p>This same Aldrovandus is our chief
source of information on the modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
dragon. He sets out, in due scholastico-scientific
style, first the alternative
meanings of the word “dragon,” with
a note that Virgil is very haphazard in
his use of “dragon” or “serpent” for
snakes in general; then the synonyms,
as “syren,” “leviathan,” and the
Hebrew <i>oach</i> (whence perhaps our
word “hoax”); then size—5 to 100
cubits (we may split the difference and
safely say about 50); habitation—Libya,
India, Atlas, Æthiopia, Florida,
etc. (with a caution that the species
born of a wolf and an eagle is probably
fabulous and nowhere to be found);
colour—red, black, ashen, pea-green,
indeed the evidence is hopelessly conflicting;
description—head of a virgin
or wild-boar, goose-feet or talons or
hoofs (they probably vary); St. Augustine
confirms Herodotus’ opinion that
they fly; poison—more virulent in the
hotter climes; jaw—some say very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
large, some say very small, some say
two rows of teeth, some say three, and
the number is in any case uncertain;
manners and customs—very vigilant
and fond of gold (so we see why they
are normally set to guard treasures),
not afraid of men, and able to throw
elephants with their tails: four or
five, says Pliny, will twine their tails
together for a long flight and so cover
the distance at an incredible speed;
very fierce, but Heracleides, the philosopher,
had one so tame that it followed
him about like a dog; birth—the
evidence is conflicting as to whether
from eggs or immediately. Remedies
against their poison—red mullet applied
externally or (better) internally, or
(best of all) the head of a dragon
skinned and applied to the bite. Capture—men
of the most magnificent
courage drug them with opium-seeds,
so as to obtain the draconite; a scarlet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
cloak and the appropriate incantation
are effective, and an axe has been tried
with success: a useful trick is to catch
them when they are preoccupied with an
elephant-fight (their customary recreation),
and another very good plan is to
put down sulphur, which the creature
eagerly gulps down and then moving to
the nearest river drinks until it bursts.
(This was the device of the great
Cracus, who gave his name to Cracow.
It is an elaboration of the Prophet
Daniel’s method of dealing with Bal’s
dragon—that holy man’s mixture, it
will be remembered, itself exploded the
dragon; but the march of science and
the closer study of animal-habits no
doubt made Cracus’ scheme more convincing.)</p>

<p>The eyes are precious stones and the
teeth ivory; the fat is a sovereign
remedy against poison, fever, and
blear-eyes; the spine is a great cure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
for toothache; the gall-bladder and
intestines mixed with wine effect more
than was ever claimed for Colman’s
mustard in the bath, removing warts.
It is very lucky to bury a dragon’s head
under the front doorstep, and the eyes
make a fine poison and send away
nightmares: and so on and so forth—all
this less than three centuries ago.</p>

<p>A little later, about 1660, the learned
Jesuit Kircher visited the Alps, and,
though discounting many devils as
due to the credulity of the peasantry,
could not resist the conclusion that so
horrid and inhospitable a country could
only have been intended by God to
harbour dragons, especially when a
public notice in the Church of St.
Leodegarius (our old friend St. Leger,
the patron-saint of bookmakers?) in
Lucerne told how a man “paused
some months in a cave with two
dragons, who were either naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
amiable or were calmed by his energetic
appeals to the Virgin, and finally
escaped by holding on to their tails when
they flew away after their period of
hybernation” (History does not record
whether they adopted Pliny’s plan, or
whether by a merciful dispensation of
Providence they flew so close together
that he suffered no strain).</p>

<p>The anonymous author of <i>The Golden
Coast, or a Description of Guinney</i>
(London, 1665) has little reliable
information on this or any other
subject. The people, he tells us, are
Nigritæ “from their colour, which
they are so much in love with that they
use to paint the Devil white”; and of
the elephant, “which some call Oliphant,”
that “they have continual war
against dragons which desire their blood
because it is very cold.” The book
abounds in such old tales out of Pliny
and Bartholomew Anglicus, and has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
all the appearance of a literary puff of
the Company of Royal Adventures of
England trading to Africa (est. 1662);
for what honest man could have waxed
so enthusiastic over that death-trap of
a country, where (says he) “a man
may gain an estate by a handfull of
beads, and his pocket full of gold for an
old hat; where a cat is a tenement and
a few fox tails a Mannor; where gold
is sold for iron, and silver given for
brasse and pewter?” The Company
failed shortly afterwards and was replaced
by the Royal African Company
(1672), and this may well have been
to over-spending in the Advertising
Department.</p>

<p>Doctor Thomas Browne, in his
“<i>Enquiries into very many received
tenents, and commonly presumed
truths</i>” (London, 1686) (commonly
called Browne’s <i>Vulgar Errors</i>) is
more modern, but, he, like a sensible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
man takes a middle path between scepticism
and faith—thinks we cannot
safely deny that there is such an animal
as the basilisk; but we are not to confuse
it with the cockatrice, a mere hieroglyphical
fancy, though even the
cockatrice he will not declare to be
impossible (he does not see how such
an oddity <i>can</i> be hatched from “a
cock’s egg” (<i>sic</i>: the phenomenon occurs
only in a cock’s eighth year, and
causes it acute discomfort put under a
toad or serpent)); but many inventions,
he says, are really “the courteous revelations
of spirits,” and we must not be
too cocksure of our merely human
faculties.</p>

<p>Scheuchzer, the learned Botanist who
toured the Alps in the first ten years
of the eighteenth century, frankly
adopted the compromise implicit in
Aldrovandus—always to believe half
of what he was told; but he thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
the dragon-stone in the museum at
Lucerne entirely convincing; for (says
he) a dishonest man would not have invented
so simple a story as its falling
from the sky—but rather some fabulous
tale about its coming from the farthest
Indies; and the stone not only cures
simple hæmorrhages, which ordinary
jasper or marble might well do, but
dysentery and fevers and all those ills
of which, to judge from the advertisements
in the local press, Glastonians
may now rid themselves so much more
simply. Item, a respectable citizen
returned home one evening lately “with
a swimming in the head and a
marked uncertainty about the motions
of his legs, and how can we doubt his
word when he attributes these unprecedented
phenomena to the influence
of the dragon who encountered him in
the forest?” Scheuchzer’s scientific
journals were published at the expense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
of the Royal Society of London.
Credible witnesses of to-day maintain
that “not the vestige of a dragon is
to be found, even in those wildest
regions of the Alps which ... were
especially adapted for their generation.”
Thus do beauty and romance fade
before the advance of Winter Sports
and Grand Babylon Hôtels.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V<br>
<small>OF DRAGONS IN ANCIENT EGYPT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It is reported of Mr. Winston
Churchill that, being challenged one day
by a Frenchman as to the remarkable
uniform he was wearing, he replied in
the same language that he was an Elder
Brother of the Trinity. “Ah!” said
the Frenchman, “that is indeed a
unique distinction.”</p>

<p>It is not so unique as might be
supposed. If we could betake ourselves
to the Egypt of 5,000 years ago, we
should find them worshipping a Trinity
of their own: Isis the all-Mother;
Osiris the Son, and Horus. Isis, the
forerunner of all the gods of all mankind
was the goddess of fertility—goddess,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
not god, for what could be more
evident than the female fact of birth,
whereas male assistance went long
unrecognized. The savage mother,
finding herself with child, would attribute
her condition not to a “commonplace
event which took place perhaps
many months before,” but to a
recent thunderstorm or other striking
phenomenon to which all could bear
witness.</p>

<p>So Isis ruled alone for a while, and
then in her own inimitable fashion gave
birth to the water-god Osiris; and
between them in due course they
produced the warrior Horus, who in the
fullness of time became the avenger of
Osiris, when the powers of darkness
slew him.</p>

<p>This is the bald and essential outline
of their faith. The details are extremely
confusing, partly because of variants,
but principally because the savage-mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
<i>is</i> so confused. “Anne’s Mother’s
daughter, Mother’s Anne’s daughter,”
reasons my baby; and the small boys
who deliver messages round the factory
find a similar difficulty in distinguishing
between the Buying Department and
the Sales Department. In exactly the
same way the gods of old Egypt became
inextricably mixed. The tale told of
one is easily applied to another, and
God the doer easily becomes God the
done-by; while the symbol of the god
will equally well pass for (say) the
enemy of the god, or the weapon with
which he fought. Like the old lady in
the story, they “do not distinguish.”
(Compare how our Arthur and the
Saxon Cedric, whom he fought at
Langport, were both identified with
the dragon.)</p>

<p>After this warning, the chief events
of the Egyptian Old Testament may not
seem so absurd. They centre round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
“The Destruction of Mankind,” the
original of all our myths.</p>

<p>The story is that Isis became angry
with mankind because of their infidelity,
and determined to slay them all. She
set about it with a will and the earth
ran red with their blood; but when
she was near the end of her task, the
other gods took pity on those who
were left, and determined to thwart
her. This they did by giving her some
doctored beer, whereupon she became
“genially inoffensive”—and so the
remnant escaped; and to this day
their descendants generally regard beer
with an almost superstitious veneration.
The Flood is an obvious and world-wide
variation of this theme.</p>

<p>The next stage is that Isis the slayer
becomes Isis the slain, whose sacrifice
will atone for the sins of mankind.
The grandmother goddess then becomes
a mere mortal, “a beautiful and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
attractive maiden”—say a virgin: the
virgin is then abandoned to her fate,
and rescued by the conquering hero,
and we are hot on the trail of Perseus
and St. George.</p>

<p>But, you will say, what has all this
to do with dragons? It must be
admitted that in Egypt, “the great
breeding-place of monsters,” no dragons
survive in full-blown splendour; but
these legends are the germ of all, and
from them springs the essential dragon-conflict,
the vendetta of Horus against
the powers of darkness. The dragon
has also been identified with Osiris the
good controller of water, with Set the
evil who killed him, with Isis in so far
as she is confused with Osiris, and with
Horus as the successor of Osiris, but
we shall only become confused if we
try to follow all its transformations.</p>

<p>We have come now to the end of all
our tales, and I shall try in the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
part of this section to link up all the
parts; to show you how remarkably
little essential change there has been in
man’s thinking for fifty centuries, and
how the commonplace incidents of
originally prosaic stories became distorted
and elaborated with corroborative
detail, quite regardless of the
original and often forgotten meaning.</p>

<small>OF THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF THE DRAGON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The chief satisfaction which learned
men appear to derive from these tales
is quarrelling about their common or
separate origin. The Separatists say
that their resemblances merely show
how very much alike men are, the
world over; the Communists that they
are so very intricate and so far from
obvious that they must have sprung
from a common stock (<i>cf.</i> Mr. W. J.
Perry’s and Professor Elliot Smith’s
theories as to the common—Egyptian—origin
of militarism, mining, and
many other branches of megalithic and
modern culture). Personally I am a
Communist; for it is a perfectly good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
principle, common to science and
theology, that miracles are not to be
multiplied, beyond necessity. The
question is, in any case, of no fundamental
importance to us, but it will
simplify what follows if I make my
standpoint plain.</p>

<p>When our first fathers found themselves
at large in this already ancient
world, the first fact they noticed was
that they were alive. Like all their
descendants after them, they wisely
worshipped facts, and they made a
religion of fertility; like us too, and like
all those who will follow us, they knew
nothing certain of the two infinities
from which we come and to which we
go, before birth and after death. The
next fact they noticed was that other
men died, though their minds shrank in
horror from the fact that they too must
die, and could not entertain it. They
hankered after immortality, for their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
dear ones and (later) for themselves, as
we hanker after it, and as our children
will; for in course of time it became a
commonplace of all the world that all
men must die, and this doom of the
“sad-eyed race of mortal men” is the
theme of pathos throughout antiquity.
Their souls rebelled against the bitterness
of death, and the search for the
elixir of life (to renew man’s youth and
to give him immortality) has been
“the inspiration of most of the world’s
great literature in every age and clime,
and not only of our literature but of
all our civilization.”</p>

<p>They worshipped life, and feared
and hated death. And so they
worshipped women, and the womb
from which they all sprang. For good
luck they carried amulets, shells especially;
and from being amulets these
shells came to be worshipped as the
actual source of life, were personified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
and made symbols again of the Great
Mother, the giver of life. (So Aphrodite,
the goddess of love, came floating
in a shell on the foam of the sea to gladden
the hearts of men). They noticed,
too, that water was the first necessity
of men and beasts and plants, and that
dead men and things stiffened and
withered as though the water was gone
out of them; and so they worshipped
water as the principle of life, and the
water-god was the second-born. Then,
turning their vision further a-field, they
took note of the regular motions of the
moon, her monthly course, and her
strange connection with the tides of
the sea; and so the Great Mother
became identified with the Moon. And
then as they pondered they felt the
greater glory of the Sun, and set him
up above his mother the Moon; but the
moon long remained the personification
of order and light and goodness, set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
over against chaos and darkness and
evil—though in time it was the sun, or
his successor-sun, who came to be
regarded as the prince of light.</p>

<p>They hated death, and in the
presence of it protested their belief
that somehow, somewhere, the dead
continued to live, needing all the gifts
his family could bring—a primitive
doctrine of immortality. And then,
in the presence of corruption, they
made plans to preserve the body: they
burnt incense to restore the odour of
life; they poured libations to replace
the vital juices. They tried to infuse
blood, the life-giver (for “blood,” as
we say still, “is thicker than water”) or
to find some painted substitute. They
hung the tomb with magic shells, that
the dead might be born again. And
when, after all, the body still decayed,
they made statues instead for the soul
to inhabit, and tried their charms on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
them; and from the idea that statues
can come to life grows the contrary
idea that men can be turned to stone.
The crowning triumph of their statuary
was the eye, making the statue (as we
say) “a living image”; and from the
idea that the open eye means life, came
the belief in the power of the eye for
good or evil. To this day the neglect
of the poorest grave is regarded as a
more than callous crime, and there are
not wanting those amongst us who
shudder at the desecration of the age-old
tombs of Egyptian kings.</p>

<p>Thus it was in the beginning. And
when in process of time a wise king
discovered the arts of irrigation (it may
be that this discovery made him king;
or perhaps kingship originated with the
discovery of the calendar, which conferred
the gift of prophecy: “king”
here is in any case premature), and
spread fertility throughout the land,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
they worshipped him too and made
him a living god, and cherished him as
the soul (as it were) of their land’s
fertility. And when he grew old, and
his powers began to wane, terror fell on
them lest their fortunes should fail
with him and they be all dead men.
So they transferred their worship for
the king to his office, killed him, and
made his son divine. And when he too
began to age, they killed him in turn,
and his sons after him, so that they
always had a young and vigorous
king-god. Until in time an ageing king
refused to submit, and this was the
origin of the story of the wrath of the
gods and the destruction of mankind.
Time passed, and the monarch was
replaced by a maiden among his
subjects, and we are at the stage of
ordinary human sacrifice, “human blood
being thought of as the only elixir.”
But in time that, too, was ended, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
a kind of religious reformation, through
the belief that any other blood would
do as well; and this was the origin of
the story of the rescued maiden and her
deliverer.</p>

<p>They worshipped water, and they
worshipped shells, and so the pearl
within the oyster-shell; and diving
for pearls, their natural enemy was the
shark, the guardian of the treasure and
the only true and original dragon. But
in the course of ages all this was
naturally forgotten, and the dragon
came to be adorned with all the terrors
of all the monsters of travellers’ tales,
from the python to the octopus and the
lion that lives in the waste. Any
terrible or impressive fact of life or
nature—the existence of evil, or of
hoary mountains—gave rise to a fresh
dragon-tale; and the fact was then
brought in as evidence of the truth of
the tale, very much as a politician<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
to-day will convince men of his general
veracity and wisdom by stating some
obvious truth; and in the absence of
facts, the vague terrors of untutored
minds became embodied in similar
monsters; and so in a sense they are
still, though nowadays we call the
result a “complex.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EPILOGUE">EPILOGUE</h2>
</div>


<p>I would not wish man rid of the
dragon as death; partly, no doubt,
because I know it to be impossible
(“This business of death is a plain
case and admits no controversy”);
partly because death is such a satisfactory
thing: it is always something
to look forward to. Death is perhaps
the oldest of the dragons, long since
domesticated and become the friend
of man through familiarity.</p>

<p>But there remains that dragon of
which we spoke in the beginning,
compounded of respectability and
bigotry and cant; or rather these
things are the evidence that the dragon
still exists, for they are all the effects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of terror: terror of truth and knowledge
and hard fact, the old terror of
man “a stranger and afraid, in a world
he never made.” This monster dwells
not in the desert places of the earth,
but in the hearth and home of every
man. Its appetite is enormous and its
destructive powers are equalled only
by its fertility. Like all the other
dragons, it is begotten by dogma out of
ignorance.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to suppose
(as some have done) that religion is
altogether a bad thing because it has
fostered many errors, or altogether a
fraud because it is profitable to priests.
Every science under the sun has
fostered innumerable errors, and every
doctor on earth practises pious frauds
daily, seldom solely for his private ends.
Mankind as a whole has had a hand in
these imaginings for half-a-hundred
centuries; our certain knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
our surroundings is to this day
infinitesimal; and “it is part of our
human make-up to bridge the gaps in
our experience with rumours, with
conjectures, and with soothing traditions.”</p>

<p>Not many months ago there came to
these shores a Chinese game, Mah
Jongg, so perfected in the course of centuries
that not even a Chinaman can
cheat at it. Is it too much to hope that,
with the general increase of knowledge
and the general recognition of the limits
to which our knowledge can attain, this
old world may yet produce some saint
or hero who will finally rescue
Andromeda from the dragon?</p>
